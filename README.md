## Hi, Jay Le here 👋

I'm a Data Engineer / Data Scientist and Data Analytics Master's student at Lund University, focused on building scalable data systems and applying statistical learning to industry problems. My work spans data engineering pipelines, machine learning modelling, cloud analytics (AWS/Databricks), and end-to-end BI delivery in enterprise environments.

### Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, PySpark, SQL (T-SQL, PostgreSQL, Athena SQL), R  
- **Cloud & Data Engineering:** AWS, Databricks, GCP  
- **ML / Statistical Learning:** scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, EM/GMM
- **Analytics & Visualization:** Power BI (Embedded + RLS), Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau  
- **Other:** Git, REST APIs, .NET integration for analytics  

### Current Focus
- Building **near real-time streaming lakehouse pipelines** (AWS S3 + Databricks Structured Streaming):  
  **[clickstream-streaming-lakehouse](https://github.com/LeJ7-commits/clickstream-streaming-lakehouse)**
- Strengthening ML fundamentals (RNNs, CNNs, Autoencoders, GPs, EM/GMM, optimization, uncertainty calibration)
- Preparing for Data Engineering / Data Science / ML roles in Sweden (2026)

## Highlighted Projects

### 1) Near Real-Time Clickstream Streaming Lakehouse (AWS + Databricks)
Production-style streaming data engineering project implementing a **Bronze / Silver / Gold lakehouse** using micro-batch ingestion, Structured Streaming, Delta Lake, and fault-tolerant checkpointing.

**Key features**
- Near real-time micro-batch ingestion into S3
- Structured Streaming with exactly-once semantics
- Event-time watermarking & stateful deduplication
- Quarantine path for malformed records
- Analytics-ready Gold aggregates
