## Hi, Jay (Jia Yang Le) here 👋

I'm a Data Engineer & Machine Learning Master's student at Lund Univeristy, passionate about building scalable data systems and applying statistical learning to real-world problems. My work spans data engineering pipelines, machine learning modelling, AWS/Databricks/GCP/Azure&Fabric workflows, and end-to-end analytics delivery in enterprise environments.

Tech Stack:
- Languages: Python, PySpark, SQL (T-SQL, PostgreSQL, Athena SQL), R
- Cloud & DE Tools: AWS Glue, Athena, S3, Databricks, Delta Lake, Azure Fabric
- ML/Stats: Scikit-learn, Pytorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, Gaussian Processes, PCA/PLS, EM/GMM
- Visualization: Power BI (incl. Embedded & RLS), Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
- Other: Git, Docker, REST APIs, .NET integration for analytics

Current Focus:
- Designing maintainable DE pipelines (Batch + SQL + PySpark)
- Improving ML understanding (GPs, EM/GMM, optimization)
- Preparing for DE/ML industry roles in Sweden (2026)
