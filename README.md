## Hi, Jay Le here 👋

I’m a Data Engineer / Data Scientist and MSc student at Lund University.  
I focus on building data and ML systems on the cloud, with an emphasis on reproducible pipelines, scalable feature engineering, and uncertainty-aware models.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- Data engineering platforms
- Applied machine learning
- Cloud-native analytics systems

---

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, PySpark, R  
- **Cloud & Data:** AWS, GCP, Databricks  
- **ML / Statistics:** PyTorch, Tensorflow, scikit-learn  
- **Analytics:** Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, GGPlot2
- **Tools:** Git, REST APIs, Docker, Terraform
